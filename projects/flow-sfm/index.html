    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Flow-SfM is a detector-free Structure-from-Motion (SfM) framework that leverages
      dense correspondences from UFM to build a more reliable and efficient multi-view
      reconstruction pipeline. Rather than relying only on sparse keypoints, Flow-SfM
      operates on dense flow and covisibility predictions to construct a <em>budgeted</em>
      scene graph and robust multi-view tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key idea is to use dense flow and symmetric confidence estimates to score
      image pairs, select only geometrically useful connections, and then compress
      millions of dense matches into a small set of virtual keypoints via conflict-free
      deduplication. These virtual keypoints are fed into an off-the-shelf SfM back-end
      (e.g., COLMAP) for pose estimation and sparse structure recovery, followed by
      dense triangulation. This allows Flow-SfM to handle low-texture, low-overlap, and
      wide-baseline image collections more robustly than traditional sparse-feature SfM.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="abstract">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Classical SfM systems are built around sparse keypoints and fully-connected scene
      graphs, which become brittle and inefficient in challenging regimes such as
      low-texture scenes, wide baselines, or unordered image collections. In contrast,
      modern dense matchers such as UFM provide sub-pixel accurate dense correspondences
      and covisibility predictions across views, but it is non-trivial to integrate them
      into efficient and stable SfM pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flow-SfM bridges this gap with a flow-gated SfM formulation. We first obtain dense
      UFM correspondences and per-pixel confidence maps between candidate image pairs.
      A <em>flow-gated pair scoring</em> strategy selects only promising pairs under a
      global pair budget, forming a sparse but informative scene graph. For each selected
      pair, we cluster dense correspondences into a small number of virtual keypoints via
      <em>conflict-free deduplication</em>, which suppresses inconsistent tracks and
      reduces the burden on bundle adjustment. The resulting keypoints are passed to a
      standard SfM back-end to recover camera poses and a sparse 3D structure, followed
      by dense triangulation guided by the UFM confidences. On ETH3D and Tanks &amp;
      Temples, Flow-SfM achieves high registration rates and strong pose accuracy in
      difficult settings, and provides high-quality initialization for downstream 3D
      Gaussian Splatting and mesh reconstruction pipelines.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="method">
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      At a high level, Flow-SfM consists of the following components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Dense UFM correspondences:</strong> For each candidate image pair,
        UFM predicts dense correspondences, covisibility, and symmetric confidence
        maps at sub-pixel precision.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flow-gated pair scoring:</strong> We aggregate per-pixel confidence
        into a <em>flow-gated pair score</em> that measures how useful a pair is
        for SfM. A global pair budget and per-node degree constraints are imposed
        to construct a compact, well-connected scene graph.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Conflict-free deduplication:</strong> For each selected pair, dense
        matches are clustered into micro-groups and then merged into a small set
        of <em>virtual keypoints</em>. This reduces track conflicts and keeps the
        number of observations per image manageable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SfM back-end integration:</strong> The virtual keypoints and their
        cross-view tracks are fed into a standard SfM back-end (e.g., COLMAP) to
        estimate camera poses and a sparse 3D structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dense 3D reconstruction:</strong> Finally, we perform dense
        triangulation guided by UFM confidences to obtain a dense point cloud,
        which can be further used for 3D Gaussian Splatting or mesh extraction.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Flow-SfM design emphasizes a balance between robustness and efficiency:
      by aggressively filtering pairs and deduplicating matches before bundle
      adjustment, we can exploit dense correspondence quality without exploding
      computational cost.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      We evaluate Flow-SfM on several challenging multi-view benchmarks, including
      ETH3D, Tanks &amp; Temples, and additional low-overlap image collections.
      Compared to baseline SfM pipelines built on sparse keypoints, Flow-SfM:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Achieves higher registration rates and more stable pose estimation in
        low-texture or repetitive regions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintains competitive or improved rotational and translational accuracy
        (RRA/RTA) under a constrained pair budget.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provides better initial poses for downstream 3D Gaussian Splatting
        pipelines, leading to higher-quality meshes and denser, cleaner point
        clouds in scenes such as <em>Barn</em> and <em>Ignatius</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Relation to Flow-2DGS and 3D Gaussian Splatting</h2>
    <p>
      Flow-SfM is designed not only as a standalone SfM system but also as a
      robust front-end for neural rendering and Gaussian Splatting. In subsequent
      work (Flow-2DGS), we explore how dense flow-guided monocular geometry and
      Flow-SfM camera poses can be used to obtain metric-scale, geometrically
      accurate 3D reconstructions with 2D Gaussian Splatting. Flow-SfM provides
      the camera trajectory and an initial 3D structure, which significantly
      stabilizes training and improves the quality of the reconstructed meshes.
